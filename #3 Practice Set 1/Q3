Question: Write any HTML code inside a text file. Does it work if you write it using notepad?

Answer: Yes — Notepad can absolutely be used to write HTML. The browser doesn't care which editor you used; it only cares about the file's contents and filename/extension. Here's a short, practical guide and a paste-ready example.

Quick steps

Open Notepad.

Paste this example HTML (or write your own).

Choose File → Save As…

File name: index.html

Save as type: All Files (.) (important — otherwise Notepad will add .txt)

Encoding: UTF-8 (recommended)

Open the saved index.html file in any web browser (double-click it or right-click → Open with → choose a browser).

(Code written on notepad is also copied here in notepad.html file)
